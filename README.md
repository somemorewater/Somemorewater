# Hi, I’m Somemorewater

I build things for the web and I care more about **shipping** than talking.

## What I Do
- Frontend-focused web developer  
- Full-stack when the project demands it  
- I like simple systems that scale cleanly  

## Tech I Use

- React for UI  
- Node.js for backend logic

## What I’m Working On
- Real-world web projects  
- Improving backend architecture  
- Writing cleaner, more maintainable code  

## Open To

- Projects that solve actual problems, not just demos  


I’m here to build, learn fast, and get better every repo.
